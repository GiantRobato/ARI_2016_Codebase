# Arduino Libraries

## Description

These arduino libraries were created for the UAA Robotics team for the 2016-2017 URC Rover competition.

## Installation

To install any of these libraries you can do it one of two ways: 

1. Sketch -> Import Library... Then select the library's folder location. This should automatically add the library to the `libraries` folder in default sketchbook location.

2. Alternatively, you can do this manually by hand by copying the library into the `libraries` folder in your default sketch location.

## Deleting old libraries

If you installed a previous version of any of the arduino libraries you'll get an error that says you already have the library installed. To fix this, simply go to your arduino sketch folder and delete the old version of the library in the `libraries` folder.
